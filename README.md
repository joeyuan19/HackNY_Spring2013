This was a project for HackNY spring 2013.  Along with [Adrian Vatachinsky](https://github.com/AVatch) and [Bezia Ladderman](https://github.com/darien0).  The program requires a few extra libraries to run.  When set up properly two computers can connect to a node.js server, sycnchronize, and alternatively emit sound waves.  The time delay is then recorded, exchanged, and the distance is calculated.  The measurement is essentially a counting experiment so the more data recorded the more accurate the measurement.

April 29 2013: Commited without any post-hackathon updates.  Set up to run specifically on the computers used during the competition.  Future updates for universal usability possible.
